This package contains Python code to search for UVOT images and/or download
them.  Its goal is to be a convenient method to do automated downloads
from `HEASARC
<https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/W3Browse/swift.pl>`_.

Detailed explanations of keywords and defaults are in the docstrings of the two pieces of code, but this gives a brief overview of typical usage.

Use ``query_heasarc.py`` to determine what observations exist.  Here is an example for DDO68, using a 7 arcmin search radius.  (Note that the pointing accuracy of Swift is ~few arcmin, so take that into account when setting the search radius.)  To simply display a table:

    >>> import query_heasarc
    >>> query_heasarc.query_heasarc('DDO68', search_radius=7, display_table=True)
    |obsid      |start_time         |uvot_expo_w2|uvot_expo_m2|uvot_expo_w1|_offset|

 To save to a file instead (automatically named ``DDO68_heasarc_obs.dat``):
 
    >>> query_heasarc.query_heasarc('DDO68', search_radius=7, create_folder=False)


Use ``download_heasarc.py`` to use a saved table to download the data.

    >>> import download_heasarc
    >>> download_heasarc.download_heasarc('DDO68_heasarc_obs.dat')

If you've already downloaded some data, but new observations have been taken since then, ``download_heasarc`` will only download the new data (this can be overridden with ``download_all=True``).  FITS files from HEASARC are gzipped, so the code will also automatically unzip them (unless ``unzip=False``).
